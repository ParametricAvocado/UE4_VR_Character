# VR Character - Unreal Engine

This project demonstrates a simplified version of a VR character with Hand IK and foot placement that I worked on a while ago for a military-themed Shooter prototype.

The Animation Blueprint is set up to interpret HMD + Motion Controllers contained in a Character as a VR Pose, while also allowing for direct movement via the Motion Controller thumbsticks. The character will also stand, crouch or prone appropriately following the playerâ€™s head.

The project is intended for Unreal Engine v4.19.
